Created an E-Commerce project for my final semester in BCA.

I have done all the coding work by myself and I have used plain html, css, javascript for the frontend, and for the backend I have used Node.js with Express.js and Stripe payments API for the demo part of payment, and also used AWS S3 for uploading and retrieving the images of the product, and for the database part, I kept it simple and used Google Firebase.

To run it on your system, you'll need accounts in AWS S3 and Google Firebase, and then find out the secret credentials that I have hidden in "server.js" and ".env" files and replace it with your own credentials.

After that, simply run "npm install" or "npm i" command in your folder's terminal and then use command "npm start" to run the project.

NOTE- Make sure to remove the double quotes from the commands before running them.
