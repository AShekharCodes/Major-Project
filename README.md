Created an E-Commerce project for my final semester in BCA.

To run it on your system, you'll need AWS S3 and Google Firebase, and then find out the secret credentials that I have hidden in "server.js" and ".env" files and replace it with your own credentials.
After that, simply run "npm install" or "npm i" command on your folder's terminal and then use command "npm start" to run the project.

NOTE- Make sure to remove the double quotes from the commands before running them.
